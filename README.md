# Task 11 – Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

## Cyber Security Internship

### Objective
To understand phishing attacks, simulate a phishing scenario in a controlled environment, identify phishing red flags, and learn prevention techniques to improve social engineering awareness.

---

### Tool Used
- GoPhish (conceptual simulation)
- Manual phishing email and landing page templates

---

### Task Description
In this task, a phishing attack scenario was simulated for educational purposes only. A fake email template was created that mimics a password expiry alert. A dummy landing page was designed to demonstrate how attackers attempt to steal credentials.

No real users were targeted and no real credentials were collected.

---

### Phishing Scenario
- **Email Theme:** Password Expiry Notification  
- **Attack Method:** Email phishing  
- **Landing Page:** Dummy login page (awareness only)

---

### Red Flags Identified
- Urgent and threatening language  
- Suspicious sender email address  
- Generic greeting  
- Unverified URL  
- Request for sensitive information  

---

### Why Phishing is Dangerous
- Credential theft  
- Financial fraud  
- Identity theft  
- Data breaches  

---

### Prevention Techniques
- User awareness training  
- Verifying email senders and URLs  
- Avoid clicking unknown links  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Email filtering and security tools  

---

### Outcome
This task improved understanding of phishing attacks and strengthened awareness of social engineering techniques and cybersecurity best practices.
